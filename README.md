# üìä Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques

Welcome to this repository of machine learning algorithms and techniques, implemented in Python! This collection provides scripts for various fundamental algorithms in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and dimensionality reduction.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

- **PolyReg.py**: Implements Polynomial Regression, an extension of linear regression that fits a polynomial equation to the data.
- **SLR.py**: Implements Simple Linear Regression, which models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation.
- **PrincipalComponentsViaPCA.py**: Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, extracting the most important features from high-dimensional data.
- **Perceptron.py**: Implements the Perceptron algorithm, one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks, primarily used for binary classification tasks.
- **DNN.py**: Implements a Deep Neural Network, which consists of multiple layers between input and output, designed for complex and non-linear data patterns.
- **Naive-Bayes.py**: Implements the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, often used for text classification.
- **PCA.py**: Another implementation or extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- **LDA.py**: Implements Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a technique used to find a linear combination of features that separates two or more classes.
